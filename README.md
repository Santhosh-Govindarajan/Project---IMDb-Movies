# IMDb Data Scraping and Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This is my first project after beginning my journey into Data Science. The objective was to extract data from a website, clean it, apply filters, and display the output in a user-friendly manner.

The website chosen for this project is [IMDb 2024 Movie List](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&release_date=2024-01-01,2024-12-31).

## Steps Involved

**Step 1:** Scraped data from IMDb using Selenium to handle dynamic content.

**Step 2:** Cleaned and processed the extracted data using Regular Expressions and Python loops, then stored it as DataFrame and converted as a CSV file.

**Step 3:** Loaded the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Using MySQL connector, I connected VS Code with TiDB Cloud (instead of a local server), created a database, and stored the DataFrame.

**Step 4:** Retrieved and filtered data using SQL queries and displayed the results interactively using Streamlit. Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly were used for visualization.

**Step 5:** Incorporated HTML, CSS, and additional technologies to enhance the Streamlit app's appearance and functionality.

**Step 6:** Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in data scraping, cleaning, database management, visualization, and application deployment. This has been a wonderful and enriching journey.

## Conclusion
This project marks a stepping stone in my Data Science career. I am excited to continue exploring, learning, and building more advanced projects in the future.
